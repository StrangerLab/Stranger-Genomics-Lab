  description: Understanding the biological underpinnings leading to sex differences observed in heritable human diseases is critical for developing precision medicine approaches that work equally well in males and females. Equally as important are gender-related exposures including socioeconomic position and sexual assault-trauma which have tremendous and widespread effects on disease risk throughout the lifespan. This project aims to create new knowledge of how sex and gender-related exposures impact disease and how they modify genetic risk for disease across the entire medical phenome, including over 1,000 clinically relevant biomarkers. Collaboration with Dr. Lea K. Davis at Mt. Sinai/Vanderbilt.

  description: Sex differences in the incidence, age of onset, progression, and response to treatment in cancer are well documented. This project aims to understand how genetics contributes to observed cancer differences between men and women across a wide spectrum of cancers, with the goal of generating knowledge that can have a clinical impact. The project aims to 1) Characterize sex differences at the molecular level in tumors derived from male and female patients, 2) Characterize sex differences in the contribution of inherited genetics to cancer risk, and 3) Discover mechanisms contributing to sex differences in response to cancer therapy. Collaboration with Dr. R. Stephanie Huang at University of Minnesota.
