  description: Understanding the biological underpinnings leading to sex differences observed in heritable human diseases is critical for developing precision medicine approaches that work equally well in males and females. Equally as important are gender-related exposures including socioeconomic position and sexual assault-trauma which have tremendous and widespread effects on disease risk throughout the lifespan. This project aims to create new knowledge of how sex and gender-related exposures impact disease and how they modify genetic risk for disease across the entire medical phenome, including over 1,000 clinically relevant biomarkers. Collaboration with Dr. Lea K. Davis at Mt. Sinai/Vanderbilt
