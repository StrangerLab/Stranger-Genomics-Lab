Utilizing state-of-the-art computational methodologies, we explore the intricate ways sex influences the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases. By integrating multi-omics data, we aim to pinpoint causal genes and pathways, enhancing our understanding of disease biology and identifying therapeutic targets within a 'sex-aware' framework. Our research capitalizes on our deep expertise in statistical genetics, genomics, machine learning, and sex differences, pushing the boundaries of precision medicine to improve health outcomes for all.
