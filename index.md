# Genetics and genomics of complex traits in humans

We are an innovative statistical genetics research laboratory in the Department of [Biomedical Informatics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/dbmi) and the [Ludeman Family Center for Women's Health Research](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/center-for-womens-health-research) at the [University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/). Our work is at the cutting edge of understanding how human genetic variation drives molecular traits like gene expression, ultimately shaping phenotypic diversity in health and disease. Utilizing state-of-the-art computational methodologies, we explore the intricate ways sex influences the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases.
