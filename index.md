We are an innovative statistical genetics research laboratory in the Department of Biomedical Informatics and the Ludeman Family Center for Women's Health Research at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Our work is at the cutting edge of understanding how human genetic variation drives molecular traits like gene expression, ultimately shaping phenotypic diversity in health and disease. Utilizing state-of-the-art computational methodologies, we explore the intricate ways sex influences the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases. By integrating multi-omics data, we aim to pinpoint causal genes and pathways, enhancing our understanding of disease biology and identifying therapeutic targets within a 'sex-aware' framework. Our research capitalizes on our deep expertise in statistical genetics, genomics, machine learning, and sex differences, pushing the boundaries of precision medicine to improve health outcomes for all.
